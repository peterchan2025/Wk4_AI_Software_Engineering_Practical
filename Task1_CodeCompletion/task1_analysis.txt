Both the manual and AI-generated versions correctly 
sort a list of dictionaries by a given key. 
The manual version is more concise and directly uses Python’s sorted() function, 
which does not modify the original list. The AI-generated code uses list.sort(), 
which is in-place and slightly faster for large datasets. 
However, it includes error handling using try/except, which adds robustness. 
The AI code demonstrates intelligent use of Python’s get() method,
 ensuring that missing keys don’t crash the program.
  Overall, the AI-generated version is more defensive, while my manual version is more readable.
   In practical software engineering, AI-assisted code helps speed up development but still
 requires human review for optimization and clarity.
